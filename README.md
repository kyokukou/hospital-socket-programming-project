# hospital-socket-programming-project

A socket programing project created for my networking class at USC in spring of 2021. Within a virtual machine several seperate servers ran representing various hospitals as well as a central server. A potential hospital client would create a TCP socket connection with the central hospital server and provide case and location information. The server would send UDP messages to all hospitals querying availabilty. Individual hospital servers would compute their distance to the client using djikstras algorithm and and combine that with thier capacity information to provide a capabilty score to the central server. Upon recieving all hospital results the server assigns the client to a hospital and disseminates the descion to all participants before waiting for other client connections. The entire system was executed within an Ubuntu virtual machine.

Goals of the project were practicing address structures, creating, sending, and extracting data from both TCP and UDP type sockets and managing several simultanious connections. The files/machine are unavailable to be posted publically due to USC's academic integrity policy, but the project is available for discussion upon request.
